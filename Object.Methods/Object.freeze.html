    <h1>Object.freeze()</h1>
    <p>
      The Object.freeze() method freezes an object. A frozen object can no longer be changed;
      freezing an object prevents new properties from being added to it, existing properties from
      being removed, prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of
      existing properties, and prevents the values of existing properties from being changed. In
      addition, freezing an object also prevents its prototype from being changed. freeze() returns
      the same object that was passed in.
    </p>
    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <code>Object.freeze(obj)</code>
    <h3>Return value:</h3>
    <p>The object that was passed to the function.</p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Nothing can be added to or removed from the properties set of a frozen object. Any attempt to
      do so will fail, either silently or by throwing a TypeError exception (most commonly, but not
      exclusively, when in strict mode). <br />

      For data properties of a frozen object, values cannot be changed, the writable and
      configurable attributes are set to false. Accessor properties (getters and setters) work the
      same (and still give the illusion that you are changing the value). Note that values that are
      objects can still be modified, unless they are also frozen. As an object, an array can be
      frozen; after doing so, its elements cannot be altered and no elements can be added to or
      removed from the array. <br />

      freeze() returns the same object that was passed into the function. It does not create a
      frozen copy.

    <script>
      const obj = {
        prop: 42
      };
      Object.freeze(obj);
      obj.prop = 33; // Throws an error in strict mode
      console.log(obj.prop); // expected output: 42
      //Examples
      //Freezing objects
      var obj = {
        prop: function() {},
        foo: 'bar'
      };

      // Before freezing: new properties may be added,
      // and existing properties may be changed or removed
      obj.foo = 'baz';
      obj.lumpy = 'woof';
      delete obj.prop;

      // Freeze.
      var o = Object.freeze(obj);

      // The return value is just the same object we passed in.
      o === obj; // true

      // The object has become frozen.
      Object.isFrozen(obj); // === true

      // Now any changes will fail
      obj.foo = 'quux'; // silently does nothing
      // silently doesn't add the property
      obj.quaxxor = 'the friendly duck';

      // In strict mode such attempts will throw TypeErrors
      function fail() {
        'use strict';
        obj.foo = 'sparky'; // throws a TypeError
        delete obj.foo; // throws a TypeError
        delete obj.quaxxor; // returns true since attribute 'quaxxor' was never added
        obj.sparky = 'arf'; // throws a TypeError
      }

      fail();

      // Attempted changes through Object.defineProperty;
      // both statements below throw a TypeError.
      Object.defineProperty(obj, 'ohai', { value: 17 });
      Object.defineProperty(obj, 'foo', { value: 'eit' });

      // It's also impossible to change the prototype
      // both statements below will throw a TypeError.
      Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, { x: 20 });
      obj.__proto__ = { x: 20 };

      /// What is "shallow freeze"?
      // The result of calling Object.freeze(object) only applies to the immediate properties of object itself and will prevent future property addition, removal or value re-assignment operations only on object. If the value of those properties are objects themselves, those objects are not frozen and may be the target of property addition, removal or value re-assignment operations.
      var employee = {
        name: 'Mayank',
        designation: 'Developer',
        address: {
          street: 'Rohini',
          city: 'Delhi'
        }
      };

      Object.freeze(employee);

      employee.name = 'Dummy'; // fails silently in non-strict mode
      employee.address.city = 'Noida'; // attributes of child object can be modified

      console.log(employee.address.city); // Output: "Noida"
