    <h1>Array.prototype.push()</h1>
    <p>The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.</p>
    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <code>arr.push(element1[, ...[, elementN]])</code>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>
      elementN <br />
      The element(s) to add to the end of the array.
    </p>
    <h3>Return value</h3>
    <p>
      The new length property of the object upon which the method was called. <br />
      W3Schools: A Number, representing the new length of the array
    </p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The push method appends values to an array. <br />

      push is intentionally generic. This method can be used with call() or apply() on objects resembling arrays. The
      push method relies on a length property to determine where to start inserting the given values. If the length
      property cannot be converted into a number, the index used is 0. This includes the possibility of length being
      nonexistent, in which case length will also be created. <br />

      Although strings are native, Array-like objects, they are not suitable in applications of this method, as strings
      are immutable. Similarly for the native, Array-like object arguments.

    <h3>Definition and Usage</h3>
    pThe push() method adds new items to the end of an array, and returns the new length. <br />

    Note: The new item(s) will be added at the end of the array. <br />

    Note: This method changes the length of the array. <br />

    Tip: To add items at the beginning of an array, use the unshift() method.
    <script>
      const animals = ['pigs', 'goats', 'sheep'];
      const count = animals.push('cows');
      console.log(count); // expected output: 4
      console.log(animals); // expected output: Array ["pigs", "goats", "sheep", "cows"]
      animals.push('chickens', 'cats', 'dogs');
      console.log(animals); // expected output: Array ["pigs", "goats", "sheep", "cows", "chickens", "cats", "dogs"]

      //   Adding elements to an array
      // The following code creates the sports array containing two elements, then appends two elements to it. The total variable contains the new length of the array.

      let sports = ['soccer', 'baseball'];
      let total = sports.push('football', 'swimming');

      console.log(sports); // ['soccer', 'baseball', 'football', 'swimming']
      console.log(total); // 4

      //   Merging two arrays
      //This example uses apply() to push all elements from a second array.
      // Do not use this method if the second array (moreVegs in the example) is very large, because the maximum number of parameters that one function can take is limited in practice. See apply() for more details.
      let vegetables = ['parsnip', 'potato'];
      let moreVegs = ['celery', 'beetroot'];
      // Merge the second array into the first one
      // Equivalent to vegetables.push('celery', 'beetroot')
      Array.prototype.push.apply(vegetables, moreVegs);
      console.log(vegetables); // ['parsnip', 'potato', 'celery', 'beetroot']

      //   Using an object in an array-like fashion
      // As mentioned above, push is intentionally generic, and we can use that to our advantage. Array.prototype.push can work on an object just fine, as this example shows.

      // Note that we don't create an array to store a collection of objects. Instead, we store the collection on the object itself and use call on Array.prototype.push to trick the method into thinking we are dealing with an array—and it just works, thanks to the way JavaScript allows us to establish the execution context however we please.
      let obj = {
        length: 0,
        addElem: function addElem(elem) {
          // obj.length is automatically incremented
          // every time an element is added.
          [].push.call(this, elem);
        }
      };

      // Let's add some empty objects just to illustrate.
      obj.addElem({});
      obj.addElem({});
      console.log(obj.length); // → 2

      // W3Schools
      var fruits = ['Banana', 'Orange', 'Apple', 'Mango'];
      fruits.push('Kiwi', 'Lemon', 'Pineapple');
      console.log(fruits); // ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango", "Kiwi", "Lemon", "Pineapple"]
