      /*****************************
       * CODING CHALLENGE 5
       *****************************/

      /*
      Remember the tip calculator challenge? Let's create a more advanced version using everything we learned!

      This time, John and his family went to 5 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48, $268, $180 and $42.
      John likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.

      Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops:
      1. Create an object with an array for the bill values
      2. Add a method to calculate the tip
      3. This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and do the tip calculations
      4. As an output, create 1) a new array containing all tips, and 2) an array containing final paid amounts (bill + tip). HINT: Start with two empty arrays [] as properties and then fill them up in the loop.

      EXTRA AFTER FINISHING: Mark's family also went on a holiday, going to 4 different restaurants. The bills were $77, $375, $110, and $45.
      Mark likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $100, 10% when the bill is between $100 and $300, and 25% if the bill is more than $300 (different than John).

      5. Implement the same functionality as before, this time using Mark's tipping rules
