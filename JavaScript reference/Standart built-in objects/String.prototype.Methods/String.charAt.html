    <h1>String.prototype.charAt()</h1>
    <p>
      The String object's charAt() method returns a new string consisting of the single UTF-16 code
      unit located at the specified offset into the string.
    </p>
    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <code>let character = str.charAt(index)</code>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>
      index <br />
      An integer between 0 and 1-less-than the length of the string. If the index cannot be
      converted to the integer or no index is provided, the default is 0, so the first character in
      of str is returned.
    </p>
    <h3>Return value:</h3>
    <p>
      A string representing the character (exactly one UTF-16 code unit) at the specified index. If
      index is out of range, charAt() returns an empty string.
    </p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Characters in a string are indexed from left to right. The index of the first character is 0,
      and the index of the last character—in a string called stringName—is stringName.length - 1. If
      the index you supply is out of this range, JavaScript returns an empty string. <br />

      If no index is provided to charAt(), the default is 0.
    </p>

    <h3>Definition and Usage</h3>
    <p>
      The charAt() method returns the character at the specified index in a string. <br />

      The index of the first character is 0, the second character is 1, and so on. <br />

      Tip: The index of the last character in a string is string.length-1, the second last character
      is string.length-2, and so on (See "More Examples").
    </p>
    <script>
      const sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.';
      const index = 4;
      console.log('The character at index ' + index + ' is ' + sentence.charAt(index)); // expected output: "The character at index 4 is q"

      // Displaying characters at different locations in a string
      // The following example displays characters at different locations in the string "Brave new world":
      var anyString = 'Brave new world';
      console.log("The character at index 0   is '" + anyString.charAt() + "'");
      // No index was provided, used 0 as default
      // The character at index 0   is 'B'

      console.log("The character at index 0   is '" + anyString.charAt(0) + "'");
      //The character at index 0   is 'B'
      console.log("The character at index 1   is '" + anyString.charAt(1) + "'");
      //   The character at index 1   is 'r'
      console.log("The character at index 2   is '" + anyString.charAt(2) + "'");
      //   The character at index 2   is 'a'
      console.log("The character at index 3   is '" + anyString.charAt(3) + "'");
      //   The character at index 3   is 'v'
      console.log("The character at index 4   is '" + anyString.charAt(4) + "'");
      //   The character at index 4   is 'e'
      console.log("The character at index 999 is '" + anyString.charAt(999) + "'");
      //   The character at index 999 is ''

      // W3Schools
      var str = 'HELLO WORLD';
      var res = str.charAt(str.length - 1);
      console.log(res); // D
